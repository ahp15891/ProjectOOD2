XML Document Model project has a parsing system, that parses an xml file or an xml string and create a document object which can queried. 
We can get information about the xml file or xml string and also make modification to the content.
After modification to the content we can store the new content to a new xml file.

XmlReader is used to read the xml file or string given. When the xml file has started being read, the document element(Tree structure) is made in XmlDocument. 
The document element can have children elements like  
	- ProcessInstructionElement(eg: <?xml xml version="1"?>),
	- CommentElement(eg: <!--Hello-->)
	- TaggedElement(<book>Harry Potter</book>)
	- TextElement
The tree can also store attributes for the elements that contain the same.

Once the document element is made, we can iterate through it and try to find a particular element and its children. We can also add a child or remove a child from element. Similarly, we can also add attributes and remove attributes from an element. After the changes are made, the changes are saved in a new xml file.
